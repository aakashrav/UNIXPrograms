Write an INET server & client. Client reads a signal number + port 
from its arguments, connects to the server on localhost on given port 
(using TCP) and sends his pid & signal to the server. Server then sends 
given signal to the given pid and prints this message on screen. Client 
catches the signal, prints the message and ends. Server can be single 
threaded calling just accept().
