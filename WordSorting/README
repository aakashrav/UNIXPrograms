The Assignment:

2-1) Write a program which reads stdin and prints how many times each word was present on stdin
2-2) Print a histogram like this:
word |####         | 20
2-3) Parse arguments (like -m -n) and count only words of the length <m, n>
2-4) Add optional (based on options) sorting based on frequency (number how many times the word appeared on stdin), alphabetical (ascending, descending) and length of the words

This is more about training programming in C and making sure you are familiar with common C functions like sort(), strlen(), strcmp(), pointers etc.
