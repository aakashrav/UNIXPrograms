Assignment:

Write an inetd server for TCP services. The configuration file looks 
like:

2222
/bin/cat
3331
/bin/sed
3332
...
...
...


Server is listening on all given ports together (using either select() 
or poll()), after a connection is accept on any of the ports it spawns 
new process, its file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 connects to the new socket 
and calls exec() on the program. You can expect that the programs don't 
have any other arguments. After each accept() clear the zombies if any 
exist. You can process the configuration file using only read(), open(), 
close().
