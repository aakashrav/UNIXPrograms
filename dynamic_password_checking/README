""Create a library libpwq for checking of a quality of passwords. Allow 
the library to be easily extended with plugins and create at least one 
plugin. Create a program using the library."""

For example suppose this is the API of the library:
open(plugin_data **, dictionary *)
check(pluging_data *, password, username)
close(plugin_data *)

The program ask the library to initiate itself through the open() call 
using provided dictionary of bad passwords, then it can check a 
user&password pairs if they are "good" through the call of check().
The library should load all the plugins and verify the password is 
considered as "good" by all of them. The plugins could be:
  - length (password is long enough)
  - dict (password is not in a dictionary)
  - char_classes (there are enough different characters)
  - username (the password != username)

Each plugin should contain a well-known structure variable pwq_vt which 
contains pointers to all functions supported by the plugin (check(), ...).
